    Make sure older versions of matlab don't fail on ignored argument.
    * SBML/gds_from_sbml.m (gds_from_sbml): remove ignored argument marked
    with '~'

    Bug: wrong callbacks called in Systems window.
    * systems.fig:  changed callbacks functions of n1-n5 f1-f3 r1-r3

    Default to numeric integrations for SBML imports.
    * SBML/gds_from_sbml.m (default_gds): changed der.


2011-04-26  Pieter Pareit <pieter.pareit@ Universiteit Gent>

    Bug: would not start when file in settings is invalid.
    * matcont.m (matcont): check if file exists before load.

2011-04-23  Pieter Pareit <pieter.pareit@ Universiteit Gent>

    Change resize beheavior of some windows. In the GUIDE, check the
    resize proportional option in 'Tools->GUI Options...'.
    * GUI/select_point.fig
    * GUI/select_corve.fig

    Trim the equations in the system window. This makes editing easier.
    * GUI/systmes.m (load_system): before adding equations, trim line by
    line.

    Bug: on some java platforms, the system dialog was not updating the
    wrap.
    * GUI/systems.m (systems): force resize, so callback is called at least
    once.

    Bug: gds might not contain field system, so unable to store oldgds.
    * SBML/import_sbml.m (import_sbml.m): check if field exists.

    Better handle invalid coordinates.
    * GUI/systems.m (coordinates_Callback): on invalid coordinate, don't
    erase, but reset focus.

    Beter handle invalid parameters.
    * GUI/systems.m (parameters_Callback): on invalid parameters, don't
    erase, but reset focus.

    Beter handle notification to change jacobian.
    * GUI/systems.m (parameters_Callback): only tell user to redo jacobian
    if jacobian is not computer generated.

    Remember initial values of coordinates and parameters between system
    edits.
    * GUI/systems.m (coordinates_Callback): store old_coords, and check
    them.
    * GUI/systems.m (parameters_Callback): store old_params and check them.

    Fix title of matcont window
    * matcont.m (matcont): calls to set(fig,'Name','MatCont')

2011-04-21  Virginie De Witte   <Virginie.DeWitte@UGent.be>

    Small changes in:
    gui_HSN
    gui_Het
    gui_PD

    Systems.
    * Systems/*: took systems of previous release.

    Error message fixed.
    * SBML/import_sbml.m (import_sbml): spelling.
    * SBML/init_sbmltoolbox. (init_sbmltoolbox): documentation.

2011-04-04  Pieter Pareit   <pieter.pareit@ Universiteit Gent>

    Fixed an indexing bug when an line with assignment is shorter then
    the longest name of a coordinate.
    * systems.m (parse_input): use regexp istead of strfind

    Add the names of the assignments to the syms list when calculating the
    jacobian and others
    * systems.m (symjac): go through the assignments and add the lhs to the
    symbols.

    When reading an SBML model, replace the use of nthroot by a
    complementary call to power, as the symbolic toolbox of matlab does 
    not like the former.
    * gds_from_sbml.m (replace_nthroot_by_power): added.

    Try to keep as much assignments from the SBML model in matcont, without
    substituting them.
    * gds_from_sbml.m (gds_from_sbml): changed some logic.

    Fix bug: Closing without system, or canceling without previous system.
    * GUI/systems.m (cancel_Callback): check if oldgds is set.
    * matcont.m (exit_callback): check if system is field of gds.

    Added better visual indication that matcont is working on model.
    * GUI/systems.m (ok_Callback): added calls to waitbar.
    * SBML/import_sbml.m (import_sbml.m): added calls to waitbar.
    * SBML/gds_from_sbml.m (gds_from_sbml.m): added calls to waitbar.

2011-04-03  Pieter Pareit   <pieter.pareit@ Universiteit Gent>

    Placed settings of SBML in it's own folder so it does not gets overwritten
    * import_sbml.m (import_sbml): settings

    Made procedure to test installation of SBML Toolbox more robust
    * init_sbmltoolbox.m (test_libsbml): added call to GetParameters

    Made it possible to handle models with functions in them
    * gds_from_sbml.m (substitute_functions): added
    * SubstituteFunction.m (SubstituteFunction): modification of original
    file from the SBML Toolbox, upstream notified

2011-03-21  Pieter Pareit   <pieter.pareit@ Universiteit Gent>

    Fix bug, new system still using jacobian of previous system
    
    * GUI/editsystem.m (edit_Callback): Reset global var hds.
    * GUI/systems.m (ok_Callback): Reset global var hds.

2011-03-19  Pieter Pareit   <pieter.pareit@ Universiteit Gent>

    Fix bug, sometimes unable to continue a system, error with datenum

    * matcont.m (make_curvename): set variable da in correct way
    * matcont.m (make_curve): set variable da in correct way

2011-03-17  Pieter Pareit   <pieter.pareit@ Universiteit Gent>

    Remember window position of main window between sessions

    * matcont.m (matcont): delayed showing of mainwindow and load position,
    then show mainwindow at correct position
    * matcont.m (exit_callback): save position of mainwindow

2011-03-08  Pieter Pareit   <pieter.pareit@ Universiteit Gent>

    Changed input field, not to wrap text.

    * GUI/findjobj.m: Added
    * GUI/findjobj_license.txt: Added
    * GUI/systems.m (systems): Added Java-hack to display horizontal
    scrollbar and not to wrap text

2011-03-06  Pieter Pareit   <pieter.pareit@ Universiteit Gent>

    Addition of SBML import support

    * matcont.m: addpath for SBML
    * SBML/import_sbml.m: added
    * SBML/gds_from_sbml.m: added
    * SBML/Substitute.m: added
    * SBML/test.xml: added
