function [output] = unitstepSB(timeExpression);
% unitstepSB: This function can be used in models to implement parameter
%   switches at certain time-instants, allowing the simulation of
%   experimental setups.
% 
% USAGE:
% ======
% [output] = unitstepSB(timeExpression)
%
% timeExpression: something like (time-timeInstant)
%
% Output Arguments:
% =================
% output: = 0 if timeExpression < 0
%         = 1 if timeExpression >= 0
